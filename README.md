> Problem Statement:
- Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid-19 cases in your country or any
region (Asia, Europe, BRICS etc) using Tableau, Power BI or SAP <br>

- Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread with
basic as well as advanced charts 

>Abstract
-This notebook is devoted to predicting the COVID-19 spread dynamics in the world using neural networks of different structures. We will see how to make predictions based on linear regression, back propagation and long short-term memory neural networks , autoregressive integrated moving average and 

>Steps or Stages
It consists of four stages:
-Download and preliminary analysis of data
-Linear Regression
-Back Propagation NN
-Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM

In first stage we pre-prepare data for analysis:

-change the data types of columns
-rows filtering
-elimination of missing data
-DataSet transformation
-data normalization

>Prerequisites
-Python
-Pandas
-Statistics
-NumPy
-Matplotlib
-Keras
-Scikit-Learn

>Results
>Linear Model
